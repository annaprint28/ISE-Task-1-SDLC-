## 📖 Case Study Summary

This project presents a comparative study of different Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models applied to a large-scale e-commerce system similar to Amazon. The main focus was on analyzing how different development models handle changing requirements, risk management, cost, and time constraints.

The study compared the Waterfall, Incremental, and Spiral models and identified their strengths and limitations in managing functional and non-functional requirements. Based on the analysis, iterative models like Incremental and Spiral were found to be more suitable for dynamic.
